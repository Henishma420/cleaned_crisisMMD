🚨 Multi-Modal Disaster Dataset – CrisisMMD (Modified Version) 🌍

I’ve worked on the popular CrisisMMD dataset and processed it for a multi-modal classification task involving both text and image data. The modified version includes:

✅ Tokenized text (input_ids, attention_mask)
✅ Binary labels for informative vs non-informative tweets
✅ Disaster category labels (0–6) for informative samples
✅ Image features extracted using ResNet (2048-dim vectors)
✅ Consistent formatting with tweet_id from 0 to 18081 (total: 18,082 entries)

The dataset is now ready to be used for deep learning models that combine text + vision for crisis response and situational awareness.
